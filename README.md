#### Changing the way you work with music, one beat at a time.

Developed at the 2015 IrishHACKS hackathon, ___tempo___ is an app which lets you control the intensity of your music&mdash;perfect for running and working out. With a bluetooth enabled heart rate monitor, tempo can pick just the right song. To lighten the load on your phone, all the computation and API interaction takes place in the cloud, through tempo's very own webservice: tempo_api. If you don't have a bluetooth heartrate monitor, you can simply select the no-bluetooth option and tempo hands the control to you in the form of a slider. It also includes a rest button to decrease the intensity of the music when you need a breather.

Stay tuned in for future updates. In the works we have increased bluetooth reliablity, UI updates and Spotify playlist integration.
